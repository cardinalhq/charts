DEPRECATION WARNING: cloudProvider.duckdb has been removed

The cloudProvider.duckdb configuration section has been removed because the
injected S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables were
not actually used by the application.

LakeRunner uses the standard AWS SDK credential chain for S3 access:
  - IAM roles (recommended for Kubernetes)
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables
  - ~/.aws/credentials file

To fix this error:
  1. Remove the cloudProvider.duckdb section from your values.yaml
  2. If you need explicit S3 credentials, use cloudProvider.aws instead:

     cloudProvider:
       provider: aws
       aws:
         inject: true
         create: true
         accessKeyId: "your-access-key"
         secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key"
